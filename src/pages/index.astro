    Thank you for taking the time to visit this website. I have created this
    website as a sample project to showcase my skills using Astro, Tailwind,
    React and Sanity.io. My main objective with this project is to test the
    capabilities of Astro as a framework for building a blog. Please note that
    all data on this website is just dummy or false data.
